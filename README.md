# Evolution Simulation

This repository contains a simple evolution simulation implemented in GoLang using the Bubble Tea framework for creating a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Overview

The evolution simulation involves a population of creatures represented by binary strings. The creatures evolve over generations through a process of genetic crossover and mutation. The simulation provides a visualization of the evolution process, showing the progression of generations and the changes in the population over time.

## Features

- Visualization of population evolution
- Random mating between creatures
- Mutation of genes with a specified mutation rate
- Simple graphical user interface using Bubble Tea

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, make sure you have Go installed on your system. Then, clone this repository and execute the main.go file:

```bash
go run main.go
