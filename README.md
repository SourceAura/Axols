# Evo-Sim

Evo-Sim is a simple particle simulation implemented in Go using the Pixel game development library. It simulates the movement and interaction of particles within a window, allowing for experimentation with various parameters to observe emergent behavior.

## Features

- Particle movement: Particles move around the screen, bouncing off the edges.
- Particle attributes: Each particle has a position, velocity, radius, center color, and outline color.
- Real-time visualization: The simulation is displayed in a window, allowing for real-time observation.
- Debugging/logging: Detailed information about each particle, including position, velocity, and color, is printed to the console in real-time.

## How to Run

1. Install Go if you haven't already. You can download it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.go` file.
4. Run the following command to build and execute the simulation:


5. The simulation window will open, and you can observe the behavior of the particles.

## Controls

- Close the simulation window to exit the program.

## Dependencies

- Pixel: A 2D game library for Go. It is used for rendering the simulation window and handling graphics.
