# Axols - An Evolution Simulation

Axols is an evolution simulation implemented in Go using the Pixel game library. It simulates the life and evolution of particle-like creatures called "axols" in a 2D environment.

## Overview

Axols simulates the life of small creatures in a 2D environment. Each axol has its own set of properties such as position, velocity, size, speed, and genetic makeup. The simulation includes features like creature movement, food sources, and evolutionary algorithms for trait selection.

## Features

- Axol life simulation with two distinct species
- Random generation of axol properties
- Axol movement with boundary collision detection
- Food sources that axols can consume
- Evolutionary algorithms for trait selection over time
- Multiple biomes (currently not fully implemented)
- Visualization of axols with bodies, nuclei, and wiggling tails

## Requirements

To run Axols, you need to have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/).

You'll also need to install the Pixel game library and its dependencies. You can do this by running:
